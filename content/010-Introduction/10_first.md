- **Upon leaving the cart, Predictive Engagement realizes that there is a high potential for the customer to abandon the potential purchase. The system then triggers a web message session to re-engage the customer and help them to finalize their purchase. Additionally based on the customers search queries and items in their cart, it will deploy a bot that will address the customers needs in the most effective manner. Whether that is a self-service via the IVR or connecting the customer to an agent directly.**
