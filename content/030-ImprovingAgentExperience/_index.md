#### Web Message/Chat connects to an agent
Predictive Engagement provides the agent with knowledge of the customerâ€™s journey from when they first engaged the website through the point they connected to the Contact Center. 
 - The agent has insight into what the customer did on the website through their customer journey and allows for the agent to see what the customer was trying to accomplish.  
- The Agent can see the following information about the customer:
    - Customer's Journey
    - Segments assigned
    - Outcomes achieved or failed to achieve
    - Searches
    - Device Information
- Using the information learned about their customer through Predictive Engagement, the agent can then provide them with knowledge, discounts, or assistance the customer needs in a more efficient manner.
